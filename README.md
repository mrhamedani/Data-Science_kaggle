**1. prodict house prices_LinearRegression:** prediction using square footage and bedrooms and bathrooms, evaluation with std
**2. breast-cancer-m-or-b-Logistic Regression:** This project aims to predict whether a tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B) based on clinical and histological data. The dataset used for this analysis is the Breast Cancer Dataset, which contains various features extracted from cell nuclei in digital images.Important features:
- Accuracy,Precision,Recall
- Data Preprocessing
